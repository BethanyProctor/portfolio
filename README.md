# Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio of the projects that I have coded so far in my coding career. It focuses on HTML and CSS and is all coded from scratch. The biggest challenges I faced while working on this project were the CSS and the formatting of the webpage, including media queries. 
	
## Installation

## Usage

Click on this link to visit the webpage:
Once the webpage is open, the navigation links will you to the corresponding section of the webpage. In the "My Work" section, each image, as well as the caption underneath it, is a link to a project of mine or a placeholder website. The contact section includes links to call, email, or visit my GitHub account.

## Credits

My TA Sandra helped me a lot in this project, through both specific formatting questions as well as understanding the layout of an HTML webpage in general.
